## Features  

### Administrator  
- Can add and remove doctors.  
- Manages patient appointments, including reviewing, editing, and deleting them.  

### Doctor

- All issued documents are archived in the patient profiles.  

### Patient  
- Can book appointments with doctors.  
- Can view their issued prescriptions and medical leave certificates.  

## Goals  
The system features an intuitive interface that provides quick access to medical documentation and streamlines coordination between users. The main goal is to automate administrative tasks, reduce workload, and improve the quality of healthcare services.
